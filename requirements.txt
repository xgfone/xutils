# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance. Changing the order has an impact on the overall integration
# process, which may cause wedges in the gate later.

# These packages below are not installed automatically, and you need to add
# them into requirements.txt in you application, if you want to use some
# functions in this package.
